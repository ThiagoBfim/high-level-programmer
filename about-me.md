# üòÅ About me

Hello, I'm a software developer who works majority with Java, since 2016.

I'm from Brazil, so my main language is not English, so if I made any mistakes with English, I'm sorry, and if you want to help, please feel free to do so.\

I really enjoy creating software, because I think software can change people's lives. This is one of the reasons why I decided to write this blog, to share what I know and help others.

_**"Knowledge is power. Knowledge shared is power multiplied"**_\

The second reason I am writing this blog is to help myself. Help me with my English, help me learn more. When we share we learn more, and in my opinion, it is much easier to understand something we did and remember things. So this blog is to help me too :sunglasses:
