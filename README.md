# High Level Programmer

Here I'll share things I like to have with me, and things I think are important for every developer to know. \
\
I'll try to keep it in 6 parts:

### **1º Mindset**

It's very important to keep learning and keep an open mind to new things and other ways to solve problems.

### 2º Software Test

All software must have tests, unit tests, and other kinds of tests. This is crucial to having a good and maintainable application.

### 3º Software Patterns

Here there are a lot of things to know. Design pattern, design principle, architecture pattern and much more :smile:

### 4º Basics

Yes, it's very important to know the basics of your main language, and it's important to keep learning other paradigms like Object-Oriented, Functional, Imperative...

### 5º Clean Code and Best Practices

It is very important to write clean code and write using the best tools because we spend 10 times more time reading code than writing.

### 6º Keep your knowledge sharp

It's very important to keep our ability sharp to be prepared to deal with daily problems
