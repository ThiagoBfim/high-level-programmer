# A Brief History of Why You Should Code with Care

The first thing to ask, is what is Care?

> **Care**: _the process of protecting someone or something and providing what that person or thing needs_
>
> _DICTONARY CAMBRIDGE_

When you code with Care, you have to provide everything that the system needs to avoid more risk or damage.

What happens if you **don’t** code without care?

A long time ago, one person that I knew wanted to send some medical documents, but the system just supports two files. And It’s necessary to send 5 files. I have to put all the files in just one PDF and reduce the size because 2 MB is the maximum size. I know technology, and who doesn’t?

You probably have a story about some technical issue, and this is the reason that you have to create code with care. The other’s lives are in your hand.

Another story that happened to me: I had 2 coupons to buy furniture, I went to the store, I chose the furniture, but when I went to pay with coupons they didn’t work and do you know why?\
It didn’t work because I should have waited 48 hours. The system creates the coupon, but it doesn’t exist in the system that receives the payment. It’s a technological error that likely affects a lot of people.

You probably have a story about some technical issue, and this is the reason that you have to create code with care. The other’s lives are in your hands.

Think about the plane system, car system, nuclear system, yes, the lives of the others are in your hands.

Think about Uber, food delivery, and many other apps that people depend on for work. This is their job, and yes, their lives depend on this software.

I hope that based on these stories, you’ll be more careful and start building software as if you needed to use it every day.

It’s not easy to code with care, but you are capable.
